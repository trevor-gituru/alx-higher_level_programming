# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
Concepts learnt:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python
- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
- What is the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`
## Task 0. Run Python file
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
-The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`

## Task 1. Run inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
- The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE` 
## Task 2. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.
- Use the function `print`
## Task 3. Print integer
Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.
- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py)
- The output of the script should be:
    * the `number`, followed by `Battery street`,
    * followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string
- Your code must be 3 lines long
```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./3-print_number.py
98 Battery street
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```
## Task 4. Print float
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.
- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)
- The output of the program should be:
    * `Float:`, followed by the float with only 2 digits
    * followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast `number` to string
- You have to use f-strings
```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./4-print_float.py
Float: 3.14
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```
