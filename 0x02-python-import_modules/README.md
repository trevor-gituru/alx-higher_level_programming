# 0x02. Python - import & modules
Concepts learnt:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function `dir()`
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Tasks
### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Write a program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`
- You have to use `print` function with string format to display integers
- You have to assign:
    * the value `1` to a variable called `a`
    * the value `2` to a variable called `b`
    * and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions `add` and print
- `a` and `b` must be defined in 2 different lines: `a = 1 `and another `b = 2`
- Your program should print: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` followed with a new line
- You can only use the word `add_0` once in your code
- You are not allowed to use `*` for importing or `__import__`
- Your code should not be executed when imported - by using `__import__`, like the example below
```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./0-add.py
1 + 2 = 3
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ python3 0-import_add.py 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ 
```
### 1. My first toolbox!
Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, does some Maths, and prints the result.

- Do not use the function `print` (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
- You have to define:
    * the value `10` to a variable `a`
    * the value `5` to a variable `b`
    * and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including `print`)
- `a` and `b` must be defined in 2 different lines: `a = 10` and another `b = 5`
- Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
- the word `calculator_1` should be used only once in your file
- You are not allowed to use `*` for importing or `__import__`
- Your code should not be executed when imported
```bash

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./1-calculation.py
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$
```
### 2. How to make a script dynamic!
Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

- The output should be:
    * Number of argument(s) followed by `argument` (if number is one) or `arguments`(otherwise), followed by
    * `:` (or `.` if no arguments were passed) followed by
    * a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
    * one line per argument:
        + the position of the argument (starting at `1`) followed by `:`, followed by the argument value and a new line
- Your code should not be executed when imported
- The number of elements of `argv` can be retrieved by using: `len(argv)`
- You do not have to fully understand lists yet, but imagine that argv can be used just like a C array: you can use an index to walk through it. There are other ways (which will be preferred for future project tasks), if you know them you can use them.
```bash
- guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py 
- 0 arguments.
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py Hello
1 argument:
1: Hello
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ ./2-args.py Hello Welcome To The Best School
6 arguments:
1: Hello
2: Welcome
3: To
4: The
5: Best
6: School
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x02$ 
```
