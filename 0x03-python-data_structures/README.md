- What is the `del` statement and how to use it
## Tasks
### 0. Print a list of integers
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

- Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
- Format: one integer per line. See example
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You can assume that the list only contains integers
- You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
- You have to use `str.format()` to print integers
```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ ./0-main.py
1
2
3
4
5
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ 
```
### 1. Secure access to an element in a list
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
- Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
- If `idx` is negative, the function should return `None`
- If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return `None`
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use try/except
```bash
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ ./1-main.py
Element at index 3 is 4
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x03$ 
```
